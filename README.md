dashp2p - MPEG-DASH plugin for VLC
=======

### Description
This MPEG DASH plugin for VLC was developed during research work on adaptive video streaming at the [Telecommunication Networks Group](http://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/) at Technische Universit√§t Berlin (Berlin Institute of Technology), and was later used in student projects on, e.g., [peer-to-peer adaptive streaming](http://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/menue/tknteaching/student_projects/completed_projects/adaptive_peer-to-peer_video_streaming/), automatic handover of an active video session between displays, etc.

A conference paper that evaluates one of the adaptation strategies used in the plugin is: **"Optimal Adaptation Trajectories for Block-Request Adaptive Video Streaming"**, [K. Miller](http://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/miller_konstantin/), N. Corda, S. Argyropoulos, A. Raake, A. Wolisz, in proceedings of IEEE 20th International Packet Video Workshop 2013 (PV2013), San Jose, USA. 
The strategy itself was described in more details in: **["Adaptation Algorithm for Adaptive Streaming over HTTP"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PV.2012.6229732)**, [K. Miller](http://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/miller_konstantin/), E. Quacchio, G. Gennari, A. Wolisz, in proceedings of IEEE 19th International Packet Video Workshop (PV 2012), Munich, Germany.
