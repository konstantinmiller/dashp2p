{"name":"dashp2p","tagline":"An MPEG-DASH plugin for VLC","body":"### Description\r\nThis MPEG DASH plugin for VLC was developed during research work on adaptive video streaming at the [Telecommunication Networks Group](http://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/) at Technische Universit√§t Berlin (Berlin Institute of Technology), and was later used in student projects on, e.g., [peer-to-peer adaptive streaming](http://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/menue/tknteaching/student_projects/completed_projects/adaptive_peer-to-peer_video_streaming/), automatic handover of an active video session between displays, etc.\r\n\r\nA conference paper that evaluates one of the adaptation strategies used in the plugin is: **\"Optimal Adaptation Trajectories for Block-Request Adaptive Video Streaming\"**, [K. Miller](http://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/miller_konstantin/), N. Corda, S. Argyropoulos, A. Raake, A. Wolisz, in proceedings of IEEE 20th International Packet Video Workshop 2013 (PV2013), San Jose, USA. \r\nThe strategy itself was described in more details in: \r\n**[\"Adaptation Algorithm for Adaptive Streaming over HTTP\"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PV.2012.6229732)**, [K. Miller](http://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/miller_konstantin/), E. Quacchio, G. Gennari, A. Wolisz, in proceedings of IEEE 19th International Packet Video Workshop (PV 2012), Munich, Germany.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n[Konstantin Miller](http://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/miller_konstantin/)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nReport issues [here](https://github.com/konstantinmiller/dashp2p/issues).\r\n","google":"UA-45213294-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
